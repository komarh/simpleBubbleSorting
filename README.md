# simpleBubbleSorting
Task 1:
Create three parallel arrays that are populated via user input.

Task 2:
Code a bubble sort to sort the cakes lowest to highest according to price. 

Task 3:
Write a loop to 1) loop through and print the sorted cake data in parallel and 2) accumulate a running total, which I will later (i.e., after the loop) divide to get an average price for the cakes.
